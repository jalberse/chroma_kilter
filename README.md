# chroma_kilter

## Motivation

The use of chromatic aberration in animation was recently explored by the critically acclaimed film *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse*. In the film, the effect is used with great success as a surrogate for depth-of-field and a way to place 3D rendered scenes in the visual language of 2D comic books. Inspired by the filmâ€™s success, Chroma Kilter is an environment to explore the aesthetic uses of chromatic aberration in rendered scenes.

## Render modes

### Non-destructive

![The non-destructive render mode](./screenshots/nondestructive.png)

This mode (hotkey z) preserves the local color of rendered objects utilizing the stencil buffer. This mode is ideal for characters or critical foreground objects, granting artists more control of local colors.

### Basic

![The basic render mode](./screenshots/basic.png)

This mode (hotkey x) simply redraws the geometry on the red and blue channels with some offset parallel to the plane of the screen. The other two render modes are based on this.

### Nodepth

![The nodepth render mode](./screenshots/nodepth.png)

This mode (hotkey c) disables the depth buffer while drawing the aberrations. 

This mode is best used for background, out-of-focus objects as a substitute for depth-of-field effects. It should **not** be used in a single-pass render, but instead be used in a preliminary pass.
