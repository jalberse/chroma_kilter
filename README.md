## TODO

- Enable user to toggle between colors for models
- More geometries
	- Sphere, dodeca, cone, teapot, monkey head (suzanne) ...
- Multiple objects at once to observe interaction
- Consider generalizing code for effect (simply pass geometry for GL_QUADS, TRIS etc instead of manually for each drawn object)
- Very minor stress testing
